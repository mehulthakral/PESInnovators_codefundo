“Chance favors the prepared mind” - Louis Pasteur

Being prepared to respond to a disaster improves the odds of restoring yourself to the point prior to that emergency / disaster.

Have a plan, know the risks, and test it to ensure that it can work.

So the team PESInnovators is working to build an application to tackle the crises rising due to natural disaster by alerting the concerned people,authorities and self organized tireless volunteers registered with us.

Also the enthusiastic local group of volunteers would be guided by our requirement based reach out system as well as providing the team members with their own location and state of well-being.

Pre-disaster WORKING:
    This would be a real time application which would continously remain connected to and fetching data from forecast and prediction sites.

    And then in turn sending information and alerts to registered users about exact conditions of their region and specific details in case of serious conditions and may be some useful tips and instructions.

    Also conveying information through twitter. 
    
    Also encouraging more registrations of volunteers organizing themselves into teams.

During-disaster WORKING:
    Data will be continously extracted about exact conditions of affected regions through Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis,Satellite and Drone imagery which in turn is channelized to volunteers and organizations doing relief work.

    Also setting up and managment of collection centers for relief material donated by concerned citizens and indicating the reachout to the people in need.  
    
    Also money donation pathway created distributing collections for management of resources by volunteers and rest given to the appropriate relief fund.
