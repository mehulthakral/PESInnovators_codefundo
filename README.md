“Chance favors the prepared mind” - Louis Pasteur

Being prepared to respond to a disaster improves the odds of restoring yourself to the point prior to that emergency / disaster.

Have a plan, know the risks, and test it to ensure that it can work.

So the team PESInnovators is working to build an application to tackle the crises rising due to natural disaster by alerting the concerned people,authorities and self organized tireless volunteers registered with us.

Also the enthusiastic local group of volunteers would be guided by our requirement based reach out system as well as providing the team members with their own location and state of well-being.

Pre-disaster WORKING:
    This would be a real time application which would continously remain connected to and fetching data from forecast and prediction sites.

	Whenever an alert is given by the sources, the app would immediately send a notification to all registered users via the app and to all other users in the locality via social media like twitter. In the age of social media, twitter would play an important role.
    
   Users would be given an opportunity to volunteer for mainly 2 jobs
    a.	For collection of relief material at collection centres
    b.	For transport of relief material to the relief camp in affected area


During-disaster WORKING:
    Data will be continously extracted about exact conditions of affected regions through Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis,Satellite and Drone imagery which in turn is analyzed and then channelized to volunteers and organizations doing relief work.

    setting up and managment of collection centers for relief material donated by concerned citizens and indicating the reachout to the people in need.  
    
    money donation pathway created distributing collections for management of resources by volunteers and rest given to the appropriate relief fund.
