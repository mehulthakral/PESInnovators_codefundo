“Chance favors the prepared mind” - Louis Pasteur

Being prepared to respond to a disaster improves the odds of restoring yourself to the point prior to that emergency / disaster.

Have a plan, know the risks, and test it to ensure that it can work. So the team PESInnovators is working to build an application to tackle the crises rising due to natural disaster by alerting the concerned people,authorities and self organized tireless volunteers registered with us.

Also the enthusiastic local group of volunteers would be guided by our requirement based reach out system as well as providing the team members with their own location and state of well-being.

Pre-disaster WORKING:
    This would be a real time application which would continously remain connected to and fetching data from forecast and prediction sites. Whenever an alert is given by the sources, the app would immediately send a notification to all registered users via the app and to all other users in the locality via social media like twitter. In the age of social media, twitter would play an important role.
    Users would be given an opportunity to volunteer for mainly 2 jobs that is for collection of relief material at collection centres and also for transport of relief material to the relief camp in affected area


During-disaster WORKING:
    Data will be continously extracted about exact conditions of affected regions through Twitter-data-Analysis,Satellite and Drone imagery which in turn is analyzed and then channelized to volunteers and organizations doing relief work. The Satellite and drone images would also be analysed to check if any rescue operation is necessary at any place. If necessary, then the coordinates would be extracted and sent to the concerned authorities to target rescue operations to that area. A donation portal would be created for distributing collections for management of resources by volunteers and rest given to the appropriate relief fund.
So How users can get started with the project ?
Users can get started by registering in the app and those who wish to volunteer can either make teams or join existing teams.

Dataset and the technologies that would be used

ML would be the core domain which would be used in the above app. We hope to make use of ML in a big way. There are many satellites revolving around the globe generating enormous data. This data can be of immense help especially in case of disasters. So a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) would be used. The before and after images of the affected area would be analyzed to target rescue operations to the affected areas.

Not only satellites imageray can provide immense data but also the social media sites like twitter. Nowadays just after a few hours after the disaster has occured, people start posting information about the ground level situation. So data mining would be used to extract information relevent for rescue operations.
